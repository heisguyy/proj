Simple and performantðŸ™‚

- `label_data.py`: to generated initial data which was then validated. I changed random_state to source for more medical doctor data.
- `experiments.ipynb`: my playground where I tried things out.
- `train_classifer.py`: script to train model based on tested params in `experiments.ipynb`. Also categorizes, the whole db and saves it as `predictions.csv` in the data folder.
