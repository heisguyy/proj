"Hello! Veterinary medicine is an incredibly rewarding career but, in most cases, clinical medicine is quite busy. A successful, well-functioning clinic is typically a busy clinic. It is good that you have had clinical experience already! There are options for lowering your workload but it depends on where you're working, the type of work you're doing, and how much control you have over your schedule.

As far as the US Army HPSP scholarship, financially it is a great deal. The scholarship pays for 3 years of veterinary school. At the same time, you are paid a monthly stipend of \~$2000 per month (greatly varying by your location). In exchange you owe 4 years active duty to the US Army.

An army veterinarian is a unique job. The primary clinical focus of the army veterinarian is to support the health of the military working dog (MWD). The typical army veterinarian performs less clinics than a civilian veterinarian because they will also spend their time doing other tasks such as auditing food facilities (ice cream facilities, bottled water plants, etc) that sell to the military. The history of army veterinarians performing food protection dates back to a time where the Army shipped cadavers (e.g. cattle) by rail as a primary food source for soldiers, and veterinarians were able to judge if animal meat was still consumable or not after transport. Army veterinarians also deploy and provide humanitarian relief.

Depending on where you are assigned in the army, you may do a mix of medicine and food work, or all food work, or all army work. It is a very real possibility that an army veterinarian attached to a deployable unit does not touch an animal patient for 2-3 years.

This fact is a big negative to many army veterinarians who originally became veterinarians because they wanted to work on animals, haha. 

At the end of the day, I think becoming an Army veterinarian for the financial benefits is still worth it because of the incredible cost of veterinary school. But it's important to understand the cost of becoming one, and the resulting time you may lose to 'develop' yourself as a clinician. It's also helpful if you have a personal desire to serve in the military, and not just because you're motivated by the financial benefits.

Feel free to reply or DM me if you'd like to discuss this career further!

"I’ve taken a nationally administered exam before, they literally made me pat myself down before going into the exam room and put all my stuff in a locker except for my government issued ID, bestie they’re not going to let you look up answers|If you’re in NYC i think it’s harder since I’m pretty sure you need to be certified in order to be a vet tech (though I might be wrong). If you go to school in a state that doesn’t require you to be a certified vet tech, I’d say you might want to consider taking a part time job during the semester. If you can pack all your classes into 4 days, that gives you a full day to work and maybe pick up a shorter shift on the weekend. It can be a lot, but honestly, I’ve been doing that every semester where I work on Fridays, and I love the change of pace and it’s a nice end to my week. But if you do this, try to find a place that’s accepting/accommodating of students if you can. I’ve never had a problem taking time off to study for midterms or finals since my boss really values school and tells me to put it first. But I’ve had friends tell me how they had a lot of trouble getting PTO to take an exam that falls on a day they are scheduled for, even when they requested that day off long ago and their schedules come out weekly.",other

"GPA is certainly important for some specialties, but the other method to land an internship/residency is networking. But it depends on the specialty of course.

I've always been big on work life balance and cruised through vet school with a B average. In my fourth year, I did rotations at locations where I wanted to do an internship and did my best to make a really good impression on the doctors there and was subsequently selected through the match at one of those clinics. During my rotating internship, I did an externship at the clinic where I wanted to do my residency and made a good impression there as well, and they took me on as a resident outside the match. (Making a good impression basically meant looking into cases ahead of time and being very prepared, knowing about the diseases and medications, jumping in to help as much as possible etc). And now I'm a boarded specialist. Meanwhile, one of my intern-mates was never accepted for residency despite a very high vet school gpa because she was.. well, very awkward.|Also, I went to lots of office hours for a couple different professors, tried very hard to excel on their fourth year rotations (when they occurred before the match) and then asked them for LORs.|I'm not too sure about what grades people are looking for. My resident mate and I both just networked our way into residency outside the match. For dermatology, a good number of the residency positions are outside the match, so you have a couple different avenues for residency. Higher grades are generally helpful for the match, networking is very helpful in or outside the match. Doing a derm internship can make a big difference, because derm is a small world and you can really meet people and learn a lot that way. NAVDF is a good place to network too.",veterinarian
"I cry at happy animal videos on my phone. I think starting out by volunteering / interning at a place to get your foot in the door and exposed to the medical side of animal medicine is a good start, especially in terms of wondering if it’s what you really want to do. As an empath, I get emotional all the time, especially when cases are really sad and we have to euthanize an animal. But that’s okay. Because it shows the owners how invested you are and how much you care. I won’t say it gets easier, and there is a level of “getting used to it,” but it’s okay to get emotional during the sad moments of vet medicine. In general practice, from my experience, there is a lot less devastation than you would experience in emergency. So feeling it out in different practices is definitely an option. Hope that helps.",veterinarian

"I took a gap year on purpose to work full time at a private clinic I was already established at. It gave me more experience with followups, different types of cases, and technical skills in general. It also allowed me to have some savings to survive during the school year. 

I would say it helped me a lot in getting me in to vet school on my first try; the recommendation letters were glowing,  and I'm sure having a lot more hours helped as well.  

The technical skills helped me immensely with 4th year since I was quite proficient with blood draws, restraint, catheters, and client communication.

There is nothing wrong with having to apply more than once; it's all about how you use the time in between. :)",other
"Amerivet Veterinary Partners. I've been in this game for over 20 years, starting as a kennel assistant and made it to vet school. My whole life i avoided corporate (VCA and Banfield were the major players at my start). eventually I crossed paths with both and got a taste of corporate vs my preferred private practice. Since my start in this game, private is almost all but absorbed by corporate players. Because of the way time has played out for the vet field, most of us got absorbed or chose to go with corporate for the reasons corporate looks attractive. I've always hated corporate veterinary, and have worked for 6 different companies in my tenure, most of which have been mentioned on this thread. I took a chance and chose AmeriVet, new company in the vet world. I've never been happier in my career. Yeah, there's still the corporate chain and rules, but the culture has been built by people who saw what was wrong with the other companies and chose to make a better choice. As a skeptical pessimist, I took a risk and I am glad to be happy with them.|Honestly, considering that they are a newer company, they have been growing and getting their shit together faster than I expected. I hired 3 DVMs 6-7 months ago(1 mentor, 2 new grads) and they have been excelling as professionals. The ideals and culture they promote and talk about... They actually follow.

Look, let's be real. Corporate is corporate. They're there to make money, like any other business. Private practice is becoming difficult to sustain in the markets that have been molded post pandemic. There's more financial security with the structure of the model they've created. At the end of the day, it's not that I'm pro-corperate, I'm pro-financial security. I live in a major metropolitan area where the cost of living is high and pet ownership is just as important as having a family. Weighing my options, I thrive in a workplace that has structure and peace of mind when it comes to being able to get paid. My ideals go well with a company that actually cares and has learned from the mistakes of VCA/Banfield/etc|*LAUGHS IN VETERINARY*",veterinarian

"Day = made|In my experience--and I'm generalizing, here, so take it with a grain of salt--I've found that human nurses tend to be some of the the most disrespectful clients in vet med.

Once, my supervisor took a phone call with a client who was requesting to be prescribed (prescription-only) flea meds for her dog. My supervisor explained that we need to have seen her dog in the last year for an exam before we can get those scripted out, and she was overdue for one. The lady protests, and my supervisor explains that it's literally the law. We HAVE to see the pet. Client goes: ""Look, I'm a nurse. I understand that's the law. But trust me, my dog is healthy. Just prescribe the meds.""

My supervisor says no.

Client demands to speak to a doctor, like a doctor is going to tell her any different.

My supervisor hangs up. It was quite literally the only time I've ever seen her do that.

Nurses are superheroes. But human nursing knowledge does not transfer to vet med. Let's all just respect each other, right medical professionals??|This!!|I agree 100%",other

"What a horrible take. In real life you can take 10 minutes to consider your options. Or you can tell the owner hey- this is out of the ordinary, let me go reference some resources. Or I do have other patients to see, I will continue to work with you on between getting these other pets out of here. People generally understand when they have a sick pet that you might not get a diagnosis upon exam only. You can also have pets drop off. You can also call the next day after discussion with your mentor, etc with a plan moving forward. You really think that the NAVLE is questions about calculating epinephrine and that’s what they can’t pass? Just make an emergency drug sheet and you’ll never have to calculate that on the spot ever again- and if you don’t, you should be using a drug manual to be sure your dose is correct. But when you see a chicken for the first time in 5 years with pox marks on its comb- you can go look that up. NAVLE is full of questions that not everyone will remain brushed up on- that makes it challenging. There’s so much info about stuff that feels very irrelevant to someone who is not going to practice medicine on reptiles, avian species, swine, ruminants, horses, and small animal AND practice public health. Need to look something up? You can do that. Need to call the reference lab and discuss the case with the internist? You can do that. Unless it emergency stabilization of a patient, there is time to make accommodations for themselves. If you really can’t occasionally take 10 minutes to be sure the treatment plan you’re choosing for this animal makes sense, especially right out of school RUN FROM THAT JOB into a job with better mentorship. And if your mentor says things like this ^ OP? Run..

"I am licensed in Korea and in USA.

In Korea, you go straight to vet school after high school and you spend 6 years at the vet school to become a vet (GP). And the degree is not a doctorate.

College undergrad degree is not required but many students get bachelor’s degree before going into vet school.

Some require you to simply transfer scores, others require you to go through the process of licensing and then transfer the license to the new state.  If you only need to transfer the score, I would do the first time vault transfer.  Once licensed, you can then pursue licensing in your home state.|I think most of us can agree they are doing damage control at this point. I think we can all agree that it is statistically improbable for the reports to contain everything for another student except their score or pass/fail status. 

But even if this were true, Name and ID information alone is enough for me to look up someone else’s score through the system. 

For example. If I knew someone’s name from my class and ICVA number, I could easily look up their birthday on the internet and log into the system and see if they passed and access their score report. I’m obviously not going to do that, but the fact that they are dismissing the information they did leak as unimportant shows their ignorance because the issue is less about the score or pass/fail.

"A) all cat spays flank with modified millers. I have now opted to just remove ovaries instead of OVH as according to a few studies there is no difference and I find there is less tissue handling. Will do midline spays if pregnant or fancy cat where owner is scared coat will grow back differently. I use Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures, monofast/monocryl for muscle layers + SC and intradermals

B) cat neuter, incision on each testicle and autoligation. No collar or sutures or glue needed. 

C)Dog spay, modified millers around ovaries as with cat spays but will go midline. Again opting for just ovaries nowadays. Hoping to learn lap spays in future. Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures, PDS for muscle layer, monofast/monocryl for SC+intradermals

D) dog neuters pre scrotal approach, closed castration ligating modified millers. Doesn't matter the size of the dog. If elderly dog will do scrotal ablation as well as tend to find these get very bruised and huge hematomas. Tend to use monofast/monocryl for ligatures + SC + intradermals but will use Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures at times.

"I’m going to have to agree with those saying OP is making generalizations based on one person’s bad experience in vet school and not based on a real general consensus.

Generally speaking, my instructors and classmates in vet school could not have been less toxic. Certainly there were instructors who had bad attitudes and/or sometimes set unreasonable standards for students to meet, but those were few and far between and you learn how to navigate their presence. For the most part everyone recognizes how challenging this profession is and help with concepts and support from classmates abound.

Perfectionism is rampant among veterinary professionals but most people get pretty good at managing these tendencies once they’ve been out of vet school for a year or two. Once you’ve been in the “real world” practicing as a licensed doctor you will quickly learn that it is impossible to be perfect and you are only hurting your own mental health in trying to be so.

Speaking as a wildlife veterinarian, there is absolutely no way that any veterinary school could provide classes that go deep into topics on every taxonomic group (and still manage to cover all the important anatomy/physiology/pharmacology/medicine topics required for medicine in any species) and I’m glad they don’t try. Dog, cat, cow, and horse medicine is the bread and butter of veterinary schools because most people who are there will be primarily working on these species, and those who won’t will base much of the medicine they practice on the concepts learned about these species. I would never be able to work on a tiger if I weren’t comfortable with house cat medicine. The same goes for avian/fish/herps/etc. - most of what we do with these groups is based on what we know about domestic species. There are many schools which do provide excellent training opportunities (didactic courses, rotations, research experience) for those with special interest in wildlife/zoo/zca/aquatics, and even if your school does not provide much of this you still have the opportunity to gain experience while in school through externships and/or summer jobs and attending conventions. This is also a great way to network as training programs and jobs in wildlife/zoo/zca/aquatics/aquaculture are among the most highly competitive and making connections is a good way to break down some of these barriers. The “real” training to prepare you for being comfortable with working on nondomestic species is through internship and residency. And even the 4+ years of specialized post-doc training requires much discipline and drive to study outside of your clinical responsibility (on your days off) in order to be prepared to sit boards to specialize. In short - this lack of experience is on you. Sorry.

Yes, there are many ignorant people who do not see veterinarians as “real doctors”. This should have come as no surprise. There are plenty of jobs where you do not face this sort of speculation regularly, and it’s your choice to let this bother you anyway. If I concerned myself with the opinions of all the ignorant people who speculate about my occupation I would go absolutely mad. The people who matter will see you as a “real doctor”, I promise. 

I work many long days (and nights and weekends). The reality of the schedules worked by many veterinarians also should not have come as a surprise to you. If you are considering working in a field like aquatics or aquaculture, much like in the rest of the zoo/wildlife/exotics world you will absolutely be expected to take some on-call shifts and work weekends throughout your specialty training and career. Depending on your job you may be working with high-profile animals (or those considered food animals) in which case many ailments are considered emergencies, meaning you have some long days ahead of you. However, even in jobs where nights or weekends are worked, a healthy work/life balance is absolutely achievable. It just takes practice and good time management skills. Having to write records at home varies from job to job but I would argue that this is less often the case and largely depends on the individual. I’m actually not allowed to write records at home in my current position. Some of my friends who practice elsewhere write records at home and many do not.

I’m sorry you’ve had such a negative experience in school. Vet school can be challenging in many ways, but it does not have to be like this forever.  Being a veterinarian offers ample opportunity to have a successful career in a variety of fields. I hope you find your happiness.",veterinarian

I have had a couple of very good vet assistants apply to WCVM and be offered non-IPA (non-subsidized) seats for admission, which meant they'd pay about $70,000 a year in tuition (in BC, until recently there were only 20 subsidized IPA seats per year for the entire province). I sat down with them and planned out housing costs, food costs, tuition, etc... during school, and then what loans of that magnitude would mean upon graduation, especially if they wanted to come back to BC (where housing costs are insane) to practice. Both realized that given the average salary for vets here, financially it wasn't worth it. One is now happily in another non-veterinary professional school, and the other went to college for a human health care program that has a similar salary after graduation with far less debt and time in school.  
There are so many of us who are dissatisfied with the profession, and I know a lot of veterinarians who have left or pursued lower-paying, non-clinical roles. But my colleagues who have that huge debt load seem especially worse off, especially concerning their mental health, as they can't afford to explore other options. So my advice would be to make yourself competitive for the in-province option, consider a non-veterinary career, or win the lottery. Good luck to you!|Compression socks and Hokas for the win.",veterinarian

"I've worked for a corporately owned vet and 2 privately owned vet hospitals, the privately owned hospitals were very different than the corporate one. I would be very hesitant to ever take a job at another corporately owned hospital as they seem to mainly just care of money - prices were higher, management was awful, pay was pretty terrible and the employee discount wasnt very great either. One of the private hospitals I worked at payed pretty well but management was terrible. Finding a smaller privately owned hospital was a God send for me, they 100% care more about the patients/clients as well as employees. It can be tough to find a non toxic work environment when your working in vet med but it's worth searching for. I was at my last hospital for 7 years and it had become very toxic, the manager would throw temper tantrums and only cared about money, including when it came down to your own personal pets. I spent about 6 months searching and asking tons of questions to potential new employers and finally found a small, privately owned practice with 100% employee discount... let me tell you, chances are if they're taking good care of their employees they're going to take good care of their patients as well.",veterinarian

"I agree with a lot of things you have mentioned, and most days I am staying unpaid overtime to follow a case, the boss isn’t always there to see,
I was also told to take only vaccine appointments at the beginning and I pushed myself way over my comfort zone and I am taking much more complicated ones. 
I did decline my day off to come in, for the main reason that it was after a full weekend first on call, where I had to come in multiple times and figure out what to do, if I was experienced it wouldnt take as much energy but being entirely new and overthinking everything takes huge energy alone, and that’s why I do need my days off to recover. 
My concern was mainly him overreacting and blaming me for reputation which I never messed with, I found it a bit unreasonable to expect a grad to do invasive surgeries in the first month. 
His job is to teach me and mentor me, he is paying me graduate salary and should expect me to learn and build a foundation with good skills not rushed in and overworked just so I can say I did it in few weeks. 
Otherwise I agree, I do have to put in more work than the others at the start. But I do need more time to recover and reflect. |Hello! I am a vet graduate from an EU university, I had Canadian and American colleagues in the university with me. Make sure you apply for EAEVE accredited schools, it doesn’t matter which tbh, after that if you want to work in the US or Canada, you have to sit the NAVLE, that’s pretty much it. If you want to work in the UK, you only need to apply for equivalence with RCVS, no statutory exam required, I personally did that in less than 1 month. I personally don’t understand why anyone would be willing to have this amount of debt that might go on for years and add to the chances of burn out, there are alternatives. The schools are not free of course, and they are 6 year programs usually (some 5.5years) so if you have an undergraduate you might be able to exempt a few course maybe but you will probably need to start and do full years. Feel free to PM if you have more questions. Take care!|That’s correct, I mentioned that EAEVE accreditation does not qualify you to work as a vet in US or Canada but if the university is listed, you are allowed to do the NAVLE (there are few steps before) and yes they do cost quite a few thousands, but I think it’s reasonable to do that as opposed to stacking up tens of thousands in student loans.

People who work for Lap of Love always seem very happy and fulfilled. I looked into it once and always have it in the back of my mind to do if I burn out again.|I have heard polarizing opinions.

On one hand, people say they love it. They get paid very well. The fact that clients see everything seems to be a benefit as they can see pets being triaged and better understand why they have to wait.

On the other hand, I’ve heard that the culture is ridiculous and the vet is expected to take every phone call because clients are told they can always reach a doctor. Even if that means taking a phone call to talk about flea control while scrubbed into surgery. 

I’m intrigued by them, but I don’t think I could do my job with clients watching my every move. And I get a lot of cult vibes from them.

"I'm not excusing it ...but it's often a strain on my brain to coherently and succinctly present a case to the next poor guy who inherits my train wreck.

Yeah, I'm busy...but realize I'm about to be less busy by transferring a patient.

I call ahead about 4 out of 5 times...and have support staff call ahead the other 1 out of 5 times. I still hate making every single call ..but am always grateful there is someone else to take over care after hours.|I'm not excusing it ...but it's often a strain on my brain to coherently and succinctly present a case to the next poor guy who inherits my train wreck.

It does include a LOT of on call cases/hours/weekends. Would not have made nearly that without living on call.|Can I ask what your contract/salary looks like on the East coast?|I produced nearly 3 million for the hospital last year. $725k commission.|So you don’t have your own OR? That’s absolutely wild. I would not be able to see/MRI/cut as many cases as I do without one. Sorry you have to deal with that!,medical doctor
"Female, medical oncologist in CA. HCOL area. Base is 265k with 25% production. Combined specialty/ ER/ GP hospital and I see around 10-12 cases a day on average and work 4days a week. I get 3 weeks PTO, and $4500 for CE|I actually just started not too long ago so I haven’t grossed beyond my base just yet",medical doctor
"Best job in the world IMO. But it’s not for everyone. I do think it’s what you make it. I like lots of things, so I do a day of GP, a day of surgeries - mostly referrals from other clinics or other clinicians in the hospital, and a day of emergency every week. It’s hard, and it’s a lot of debt, and you have to work to keep a good work life balance (at least I do), but every day is different and challenging and I’m always learning and I get to work with people AND my brain AND my hands… For me it’s awesome",medical doctor
