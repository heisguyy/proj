No_Cellist_746,"Hi! I am in my first year out of school and you put exactly how I‚Äôve been feeling into words. I can‚Äôt yet say if it gets better, but you aren‚Äôt alone. üíõ|GP - 100k base, 50k sign on bonus and retention bonus (I get it every year I sign for up to 5 years), 5k relocation, 20% production, 4-10 hour shifts per week, 10 days PTO, 1500 CE and I think 3 or 5 CE days. I‚Äôm in suburban Colorado.|Yes|It‚Äôs corporate",medical doctor,this is the correct label
raygunlock,"This behavior is so unacceptable. Please don‚Äôt worry about being a new grad, you guys bring so much new info and research with you. Please do have a conversation with the PM and don‚Äôt feel bad about setting boundaries anytime your boundaries are being broken. For reference, I say Dr. Last Name and then if we have rapport it‚Äôs just Last Name but I don‚Äôt do their first names at work. If someone keeps calling you by your first name, tell them it‚Äôs Dr. _____ and if they can‚Äôt adhere to that I would either continue to correct them or even say, hey, I asked you to call me Dr., just like you do to all the other doctors and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm going to respond to from here on out. If she chooses to continue, just tell her that when she can call you by Dr. _____ like she does for everyone else, THEN you can continue the interaction.",medical doctor,this is the correct label
heretoroastmk,Your salary feels on par for my classmates going into GP maybe 5-10k less.  Not sure what the market for the midwest is like since I‚Äôm on the east coast.  4 8 hour shifts is nice.  I‚Äôm going into ER and will be doing 3 12s a week for 145k + 22% production for comparison to new grad ER|I‚Äôm doing the 6 month training program with VEG actually!,medical doctor,this is the correct label
ReindeerVarious3024,"I‚Äôm a human doctor who has fostered many a dog, and this is eye opening to me. I had no idea it was illegal to administer vaccines to animals, and while I haven‚Äôt done it myself, I also can‚Äôt say I have ever actually looked into the topic. I have, however, been around others (also human doctors in the field of rescue work) who I absolutely witnessed giving injections to puppies/dogs that would come through the rescues we worked with. The vaccines from what I recall were provided by the rescue, but I may be mistaken. Otherwise I have no idea where/how the actual vaccine was obtained. On another note, I was often provided with human medications for dogs, and had to adjust dose based on weight. I assumed these meds all come from the same pharmacy and that there likely wasn‚Äôt actual differences in the meds based on human vs dog prescription. I do understand splitting pills doesn‚Äôt mean a standard dose will be obtained, but also thought nothing of it as I always had to split pills that were prescribed for the dogs specifically as well. Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.|Species specific dose was used.",medical doctor,this is the correct label
Kirsten,"My sister is a veterinarian and I am a physician.  Seriously, neither of us would have ANY idea how to do the other one‚Äôs job.  Occasionally we will discuss comparative anatomy/ pathology and there are so few things in common.  Like, dog uteruses have a whole bunch of pockets?  wtf?  Looks like aliens.",medical doctor,this is the correct label
Prestigious_Union_50,"I'm not excusing it ...but it's often a strain on my brain to coherently and succinctly present a case to the next poor guy who inherits my train wreck.

Yeah, I'm busy...but realize I'm about to be less busy by transferring a patient.

I call ahead about 4 out of 5 times...and have support staff call ahead the other 1 out of 5 times. I still hate making every single call ..but am always grateful there is someone else to take over care after hours.|I'm not excusing it ...but it's often a strain on my brain to coherently and succinctly present a case to the next poor guy who inherits my train wreck.

dedcrypticginger,It does include a LOT of on call cases/hours/weekends. Would not have made nearly that without living on call.|Can I ask what your contract/salary looks like on the East coast?|I produced nearly 3 million for the hospital last year. $725k commission.|So you don‚Äôt have your own OR? That‚Äôs absolutely wild. I would not be able to see/MRI/cut as many cases as I do without one. Sorry you have to deal with that!,medical doctor,this is the correct label
Amythyst72,"Female, medical oncologist in CA. HCOL area. Base is 265k with 25% production. Combined specialty/ ER/ GP hospital and I see around 10-12 cases a day on average and work 4days a week. I get 3 weeks PTO, and $4500 for CE|I actually just started not too long ago so I haven‚Äôt grossed beyond my base just yet",medical doctor,this is the correct label
DrZefe,"Best job in the world IMO. But it‚Äôs not for everyone. I do think it‚Äôs what you make it. I like lots of things, so I do a day of GP, a day of surgeries - mostly referrals from other clinics or other clinicians in the hospital, and a day of emergency every week. It‚Äôs hard, and it‚Äôs a lot of debt, and you have to work to keep a good work life balance (at least I do), but every day is different and challenging and I‚Äôm always learning and I get to work with people AND my brain AND my hands‚Ä¶ For me it‚Äôs awesome",medical doctor,this is the correct label
unbuhhlievable,"Do not let people gaslight you into thinking you‚Äôre being unreasonable and unteachable. It‚Äôs one thing to willfully ignore advice from your techs due to pride and quite another to have techs speak to you rudely and treat you poorly. I think anyone with any semblance of emotional intelligence knows the difference between someone trying to help you (‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen another doc use this dose instead of this‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybe try this technique I‚Äôve seen work well before‚Äù) vs belittling you (‚ÄúI could have done it better/faster‚Äù, ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt know wtf they‚Äôre doing‚Äù)
I definitely experienced this in my first job out - an internship where the interns were treated like shit-under-your-shoe by senior docs and this behavior trickled down to some of the techs who felt the need to put us in our place as interns. Of course this doesn‚Äôt apply to all techs. In fact a vast majority were wonderful and I was happy to work with them and listen to their many stories and pieces of valuable advice. Unfortunately there‚Äôs just some people you will probably never be friends with. They likely feel insecure about their own knowledge and put others down to feel better about their skill level. You might have to just learn how to tolerate them enough to work with them. Or move jobs. I‚Äôm at another position where I get along well with ALL our techs and there is mutual respect and open communication. Made me realize that I never had a problem listening to advice/instructions coming from a tech, just didn‚Äôt like being treated like crap. 
I don‚Äôt ask my techs to call me Dr as I truly don‚Äôt  care. But if I did, I know they would never refuse.|Do not let people gaslight you into thinking you‚Äôre being unreasonable and unteachable.

""tech"" is usually for ""vet tech"" aka a vet assistant, doctors usually call their workers admins or nurses. but this one is unclear. i would probably just not include it in the training set as I'm not sure the correct label for it is. If its in a medical subreddit then likely medical doctor, if in a vet subreddit then likely a vet. Sounds like this a either a vet or doctor."
