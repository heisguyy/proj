kaaliackerman,"The banfield at my petsmart is actually great. So I'm good, but thanks for the advice.|I currently work for petsmart which is a crap corporation as well. I've worked here 7 years and know the staff at the banfield. They are amazing people, and even tho the corporation may be crap, im sure they will make up for it. They are a team I really want to be part of. They are nice ,caring, and hard-working. And even tho we are two separate companies, my store and banfield have always worked close together, so we all already look at each other as coworkers. I'm comfortable with my decision and I really hope I do get the job.",other
HiddenJindo,"Hello! Veterinary medicine is an incredibly rewarding career but, in most cases, clinical medicine is quite busy. A successful, well-functioning clinic is typically a busy clinic. It is good that you have had clinical experience already! There are options for lowering your workload but it depends on where you're working, the type of work you're doing, and how much control you have over your schedule.

As far as the US Army HPSP scholarship, financially it is a great deal. The scholarship pays for 3 years of veterinary school. At the same time, you are paid a monthly stipend of \~$2000 per month (greatly varying by your location). In exchange you owe 4 years active duty to the US Army.

An army veterinarian is a unique job. The primary clinical focus of the army veterinarian is to support the health of the military working dog (MWD). The typical army veterinarian performs less clinics than a civilian veterinarian because they will also spend their time doing other tasks such as auditing food facilities (ice cream facilities, bottled water plants, etc) that sell to the military. The history of army veterinarians performing food protection dates back to a time where the Army shipped cadavers (e.g. cattle) by rail as a primary food source for soldiers, and veterinarians were able to judge if animal meat was still consumable or not after transport. Army veterinarians also deploy and provide humanitarian relief.

Depending on where you are assigned in the army, you may do a mix of medicine and food work, or all food work, or all army work. It is a very real possibility that an army veterinarian attached to a deployable unit does not touch an animal patient for 2-3 years.

This fact is a big negative to many army veterinarians who originally became veterinarians because they wanted to work on animals, haha. 

At the end of the day, I think becoming an Army veterinarian for the financial benefits is still worth it because of the incredible cost of veterinary school. But it's important to understand the cost of becoming one, and the resulting time you may lose to 'develop' yourself as a clinician. It's also helpful if you have a personal desire to serve in the military, and not just because you're motivated by the financial benefits.

Feel free to reply or DM me if you'd like to discuss this career further!

rotten-cheese-ball,"I’ve taken a nationally administered exam before, they literally made me pat myself down before going into the exam room and put all my stuff in a locker except for my government issued ID, bestie they’re not going to let you look up answers|If you’re in NYC i think it’s harder since I’m pretty sure you need to be certified in order to be a vet tech (though I might be wrong). If you go to school in a state that doesn’t require you to be a certified vet tech, I’d say you might want to consider taking a part time job during the semester. If you can pack all your classes into 4 days, that gives you a full day to work and maybe pick up a shorter shift on the weekend. It can be a lot, but honestly, I’ve been doing that every semester where I work on Fridays, and I love the change of pace and it’s a nice end to my week. But if you do this, try to find a place that’s accepting/accommodating of students if you can. I’ve never had a problem taking time off to study for midterms or finals since my boss really values school and tells me to put it first. But I’ve had friends tell me how they had a lot of trouble getting PTO to take an exam that falls on a day they are scheduled for, even when they requested that day off long ago and their schedules come out weekly.",other

erincatsj,"Can only speak on my personal experience with idexx, as a tech I find running all the tests to be quick and simple. It’s a pretty straightforward process for any staff that might be unfamiliar with in house machines. They even give you explicit directions on the screen when running dilutions. 

In my clinic we have most of the machines available: catalyst for chemistries/lytes/T4 (takes 10-15 min depending on which tests you’re running), procyte for CBC (takes only a couple minutes), sedivue for UA (I hate the strip reader but LOVE that the sedivue takes pictures of the sample so you can double check for bacteria/crystals/cells- way simpler than staining a UA to read, takes about 5-10 min) , coag for PT/PTT (3-5 min), blood gas values (10 min?? Not as confident on that number because we use it infrequently), and the snap readers. In an ER setting all of them get pretty regular use aside from the blood gas, mostly because the docs just prefer to run those on the istat. 

With our software, the results connect automatically as well which is really convenient. Idexx customer service is also great- if a slide/cartridge won’t run for some reason on any of the machines (even if there wasn’t enough sample), we can make a note of it and they will refund us for that test. They were also quick to respond when we ran low on our reagent kit on a extra busy weekend, and got one out to us before we lost the capability to run CBCs (:",other

catanddogtor,"GPA is certainly important for some specialties, but the other method to land an internship/residency is networking. But it depends on the specialty of course.

I've always been big on work life balance and cruised through vet school with a B average. In my fourth year, I did rotations at locations where I wanted to do an internship and did my best to make a really good impression on the doctors there and was subsequently selected through the match at one of those clinics. During my rotating internship, I did an externship at the clinic where I wanted to do my residency and made a good impression there as well, and they took me on as a resident outside the match. (Making a good impression basically meant looking into cases ahead of time and being very prepared, knowing about the diseases and medications, jumping in to help as much as possible etc). And now I'm a boarded specialist. Meanwhile, one of my intern-mates was never accepted for residency despite a very high vet school gpa because she was.. well, very awkward.|Also, I went to lots of office hours for a couple different professors, tried very hard to excel on their fourth year rotations (when they occurred before the match) and then asked them for LORs.|I'm not too sure about what grades people are looking for. My resident mate and I both just networked our way into residency outside the match. For dermatology, a good number of the residency positions are outside the match, so you have a couple different avenues for residency. Higher grades are generally helpful for the match, networking is very helpful in or outside the match. Doing a derm internship can make a big difference, because derm is a small world and you can really meet people and learn a lot that way. NAVDF is a good place to network too.",veterinarian

history_is_legend,"I cry at happy animal videos on my phone. I think starting out by volunteering / interning at a place to get your foot in the door and exposed to the medical side of animal medicine is a good start, especially in terms of wondering if it’s what you really want to do. As an empath, I get emotional all the time, especially when cases are really sad and we have to euthanize an animal. But that’s okay. Because it shows the owners how invested you are and how much you care. I won’t say it gets easier, and there is a level of “getting used to it,” but it’s okay to get emotional during the sad moments of vet medicine. In general practice, from my experience, there is a lot less devastation than you would experience in emergency. So feeling it out in different practices is definitely an option.

shadowofzero,"Amerivet Veterinary Partners. I've been in this game for over 20 years, starting as a kennel assistant and made it to vet school. My whole life i avoided corporate (VCA and Banfield were the major players at my start). eventually I crossed paths with both and got a taste of corporate vs my preferred private practice. Since my start in this game, private is almost all but absorbed by corporate players. Because of the way time has played out for the vet field, most of us got absorbed or chose to go with corporate for the reasons corporate looks attractive. I've always hated corporate veterinary, and have worked for 6 different companies in my tenure, most of which have been mentioned on this thread. I took a chance and chose AmeriVet, new company in the vet world. I've never been happier in my career.

Private practice is becoming difficult to sustain in the markets that have been molded post pandemic. There's more financial security with the structure of the model they've created. At the end of the day, it's not that I'm pro-corperate, I'm pro-financial security. I live in a major metropolitan area where the cost of living is high and pet ownership is just as important as having a family.

BBG1308,"High speed scanners make quick work of this.

It helps if you separate out the actual medical record from other documents such as consent forms so that when you want to look at history, you get nothing but the chart notes. You certainly can and should save all those other documents, but just do it in a separate file.

What's slow is making sure that if you rely on your Cornerstone database to give alerts such as diagnostic codes or allergies or adverse reactions or handling recommendations or existing authorized prescription refills...each record has to be looked at and those things manually entered.

Our DVMs loathe looking at scanned records. Even \~ eight years down line we still have some paper charts because of this. If the patient's chart is more than an inch thick...hard nope on scanning. If the patient is of a certain age...hard nope on scanning. If the patient hasn't been seen in two years...hard nope on scanning.

Your time is more valuable spent generating income for the practice than scanning records. See patients. Deal with paper charts for the ones that are enormous or are likely to pass soonish or may never come back. Pay someone else to scan the rest. You still have to have someone (you or a well-trained tech) to read the record and enter any necessary database info.|> I also see many people saying RVT school does not transfer to DVM school in any way.

It doesn't count at all towards a four year graduate degree in veterinary medicine.  But veterinary students usually complete a four year bachelor's degree prior to applying to veterinary school.  

If the RVT program is at an accredited institution such as a community college, some of their credits can be transferred to a four year university and may help them achieve their bachelor's in less than four full years.

RVT school is primarily a vocational program. Thus the ""T"" for technician. They don't diagnose or prescribe.

Don't get me wrong. RVTs are worth their weight in gold. But it's a completely different level of education and type of training than what a veterinarian receives.",veterinarian

Regarding Filecoin, I did see that their requirements are much higher, and the setup process is more involved, so I stopped looking into. Too much for me :-) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11zmvfy/what_other_similarfun_projects_do_you_run/jdv89u2/",other

cheesefeast,"What a horrible take. In real life you can take 10 minutes to consider your options. Or you can tell the owner hey- this is out of the ordinary, let me go reference some resources. Or I do have other patients to see, I will continue to work with you on between getting these other pets out of here. People generally understand when they have a sick pet that you might not get a diagnosis upon exam only. You can also have pets drop off. You can also call the next day after discussion with your mentor, etc with a plan moving forward. You really think that the NAVLE is questions about calculating epinephrine and that’s what they can’t pass? Just make an emergency drug sheet and you’ll never have to calculate that on the spot ever again- and if you don’t, you should be using a drug manual to be sure your dose is correct. But when you see a chicken for the first time in 5 years with pox marks on its comb- you can go look that up. NAVLE is full of questions that not everyone will remain brushed up on- that makes it challenging. There’s so much info about stuff that feels very irrelevant to someone who is not going to practice medicine on reptiles, avian species, swine, ruminants, horses, and small animal AND practice public health. Need to look something up? You can do that. Need to call the reference lab and discuss the case with the internist? You can do that. Unless it emergency stabilization of a patient, there is time to make accommodations for themselves. If you really can’t occasionally take 10 minutes to be sure the treatment plan you’re choosing for this animal makes sense, especially right out of school RUN FROM THAT JOB into a job with better mentorship. And if your mentor says things like this ^ OP? Run..

Give yourself some grace, no one here is a failure <3|It’s funny because I know that I would never judge anyone for failing— this test is absolutely not indicative of your abilities and intelligence as a doctor— yet I know that I will feel shame and disappointment, and I’m dreading the part when people ask if I passed. I can’t fake it. But the test was long. I felt ready as ever walking in, and was so numb when I walked out. Took me like a full week to process it and then I went, “oh my GOD I think I failed!”

I’m crossing my fingers and toes for everyone this week. We can do this! And we can do it again if we must 🤍|Nothin like a little extra stress from the ICVA faking us out on a super fun day (I have stress colitis)|Me too I was in rounds on my clinical rotation and was waiting for it to be over— went to check and I get the no documents available message! I should’ve just been a big girl and clicked the pdf when i had the chance. This is torture!! 😭|some of my class can see theirs, but i can't see mine and neither can a few others. I'm not sure if its related to whether the result is pass or fail....hope not|Just got mine too|imo that would be cruel and unusual punishment|i think they can still see it|no idea, they haven't said|where? i dont see it|I’m also waiting 😫 some days i feel like “I kicked ass I DESERVE to pass” and then other days I’m like “you left seven questions open on section two bc you didn’t time manage so that’s probably the 7 questions you needed to pass”. It’s so hard. Plus it’s clinical year now and the minute we get that email everyone will be talking about it… I’m not sure my poker face is too good. Screw the shame and guilt. Who CARES if you fail, we will get up and do it again and we will learn something that may save a life one day. Happens for a reason. But it in no way reflects how amazing we’ve all done to have gotten this far, and (I have to remind myself too) a fail does NOT mean you will be any less worthy to work with animals and love what you do. 

Soooo long story short I’m panicking and feeling nauseous with all of you every time my email gives me a notification! Good luck to you all, and no matter what happens- WE WILL ALL BE GREAT VETERINARIANS! 🤍",veterinarian
Rough_Bluejay,"Okay, and i imagine payments between the client/protocol, and protocol/node are divided into smaller amounts and not made at the same time with the same amount to prevent any kind of correlation between client and node.

irregardlesslike,"Yes, there is a dress code and they review it during orientation. For current vet students, it’s neat and clean. Jeans, leggings, skirts, pants and dresses are all good but will depend on what you’re doing that day. Closed toe shoes or otherwise appropriate footwear for the day’s activities. 

Avoid shorts, gym clothes, ripped jeans and beachwear. You’ll be in scrubs or overalls for some rotations. Orientation week is business casual, I believe. 

If you’re on a campus tour and not accepted yet, wear business casual. 

Edit: yes, it’s enforced.

Present-Diamond7994,"I am licensed in Korea and in USA.

In Korea, you go straight to vet school after high school and you spend 6 years at the vet school to become a vet (GP). And the degree is not a doctorate. In USA, you have to go to college and complete prerequisite courses first in order to be able to apply for the vet school. College undergrad degree is not required but many students get bachelor’s degree before going into vet school. Once you graduate from the vet school, you are a doctor (the degree is called Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine). 

I am Korean but studies in the states. I did not pursue specialty, and I still get paid pretty well (working 30h per week; 180k base + production; 100k sign-on bonus for 2y agreement). I am not looking to open my own practice just yet.",veterinarian
StardustSweeper,"I haven't officially started working there as a vet but I am going to soon and have done student jobs and externships with them previously.

I know people who have had bad experiences and that's 100% valid but I personally have had good ones and know others who have too. In general, I think (and have been told by others) that at the very least it's a god stepping stone for you to begin your career, get comfortable practicing, and have good mentorship.|thank you!!|Please please don't give up. I promise you most people feel some time of anxiety about pursuing a degree/profession like this. It's a major thing that not many people get to pursue! I can't tell you how stressed I was when I was applying, feeling like I was wasting my time and gonna flunk out in the first semester. I can't tell you how many times I cried about flunking out when i was actually in that first semester lol. I'm graduating in May.

My motto is always that it's better to try and fail than to not try at all and wonder what could've been. Stay on the right path, get your study habits in order, continue to volunteer, shadow and do other programs to make sure it's really what you wanna do and get experience. You can do it!|Some of my classmates got theirs but mine still says no documents. I'm shaking 😭😭😭😭|I'm in the same boat and so anxious. I took my last practice test about a month before the actual exam and the passing score was right in the middle of my range. I just hope the last month of studying paid off to bump me up some. I'm trying to be positive because most people say they felt like they failed but ended up scoring higher than their ICVA scores. It's so hard to stay hopeful though 😭",other

pixiegurly,"LVT here. 

I think it's really common for techs to be wary, suspicious, and on guard around new grad drs. Enough come into the clinic where the techs have been established, and start with a big ego , disregard our input, and honestly, make mistakes that cause harm. It's absolutely not a reason to be disrespectful tho, but that's definitely how it manifests in some. In which case just demonstrating respect and listening and considering input and *letting us do our part of the job*. 


The other thing is, a TON of techs have a huge chip on their shoulder. Especially, IME, OJT trained ones without a license. I think it's just because of how in general our skills (as are y'all's) are so devalued by society, clients, and also Drs. Plus all the other bs that is in veterinary medicine. When I was new to ER and recently graduated, I had a very skillful experienced OJT tech tell me I wasn't a real tech and my license was just a piece of paper bc I didn't have the same experience. 🙄 And I always valued and respected those with more experience than me. When he said that, I quickly shut it down with no, I have a license I AM a tech, and if he liked he could call me a baby tech bc I'm new and fine with that term. We didn't have a problem after that. I've also seen some say an LVT wasn't an LVT bc they had been outta practice for a while and were rusty on skills. Any excuse to be 'better than.' like crabs in a bucket. It's dumb. 


If directly talking to the tech and asking them hey, what's with you refusing to call me Dr, what can I do to make you feel more comfortable working with me and respecting my title and schooling? (Bc asking like that, in the 'what can I do' way is far less likely to put someone on offense, and may even cause them to consider their role in the relationship.) if that doesn't work, talk to the manager or HR or lead tech or supervisor or lead Dr or whomever about the issue so they can handle it.|LVT here.

Customizability is key for me which is where Scribenote wins significantly over Goldie. They're constantly adding features and releasing updates that are improving usability and the medical notes produced. It is definitely one of the higher price points, though. 

The free trial is based on number of medical records instead of a timeframe which is also nice. This is my referral link which is good for an extra 25 medical records on top of the usual 50:

i’m currently a senior in high school, and i’m interested in pursuing veterinary medicine as a career.

i was recently accepted to university, but there is no “pre-vet” track, so i was wondering what coursework and experience is required to apply to vet programs in the US. is there any specific exams i need to take? 

if anyone has tips or advice on how i can plan out my next four years that would be really appreciated and awesome 😊🐾

In terms of getting in to vet school you will have to take the pre-req courses(chemistry, biochem, orgo, ect) but no specific degree is required so you just need to complete those courses. A full list can be found on most vet school websites. It is good you have volunteering experience with shelters but you may want to find a way to get more experience directly with veterinarians as well. In my experience schools seem to like applicants who are arebswitching carreers. It wouldn't hurt to reach out the admissions office of some schools you're interested in and just ask as well. Good luck, hope to see you in the field.|I would be happy to answer questions along the way, I am from the US though so may not be as helpful with certain questions having to do with that.|Hello, I am a current 4th year vet student who shares your passion for surgery. It is a long journey. The bare minimum requirements to become a boarded surgeon are achieving your DVM, one year of a rotating internship after vet school graduation, and a 3-year residency. This is easier said than done, and it's not uncommon to have to do multiple internships (known as specialty internships, these would be one year programs that are surgery focused) before getting a residency. During your surgery residency you will be required to take two board exams, and you have to publish at least one paper in a veterinary journal. It's never too early to start gaining surgical experience. A good place to start would be a local shelter that does high volume spay/neuters; they're typically always looking for volunteers. If you have any additional questions I'd be happy to answer.|Not a dumb question. As a rule of thumb it is not ideal. Usually 30-60k a year. It depends on where you go. Private internships and residencies pay more in general like 60-80k but academic is much lower, like 20-50k.",other

I had colleagues who did not start until April or even close to graduation, and I had colleagues who did not start looking until after graduation - all of them found a job with plenty of time to spare. 

  
As for interviewing during rotations, everyone does this differently. I used externships as interviews. Others did half-day working interviews during rotations or used vacation time. At this point your school people will be aware that you and your peers will be doing some serious job hunting and most rotations were fine with people taking a few hours off during some day, as long as it was cleared in advance.|Female, VA.

I also received offers from Banfield (too corporate for me) and an SVP (Southern Vet Partners) clinic and the SVP offer had much more corporate red flags hidden in the small print and there was no focus on the support staff in their mandates.|My experience with the mentorship program they have has been overall positive, but I do think this depends greatly on the doctors and management at the individual practices too. We are basically assigned a mentor, should have weekly meetings with them, and our schedules should overlap closely with theirs. The management at my clinic has been very focused on ""Do not drown the new grad, ease into things"" which is not the situation at every place.

I do know one new grad at a different MVP clinic whose assigned mentor went on maternity leave 2 months after she started and she was left hanging a bit.

C)Dog spay, modified millers around ovaries as with cat spays but will go midline. Again opting for just ovaries nowadays. Hoping to learn lap spays in future. Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures, PDS for muscle layer, monofast/monocryl for SC+intradermals

D) dog neuters pre scrotal approach, closed castration ligating modified millers. Doesn't matter the size of the dog.

watermelon-milkshake,"I’m going to have to agree with those saying OP is making generalizations based on one person’s bad experience in vet school and not based on a real general consensus.

Generally speaking, my instructors and classmates in vet school could not have been less toxic. Certainly there were instructors who had bad attitudes and/or sometimes set unreasonable standards for students to meet, but those were few and far between and you learn how to navigate their presence. For the most part everyone recognizes how challenging this profession is and help with concepts and support from classmates abound.

Perfectionism is rampant among veterinary professionals but most people get pretty good at managing these tendencies once they’ve been out of vet school for a year or two. Once you’ve been in the “real world” practicing as a licensed doctor you will quickly learn that it is impossible to be perfect and you are only hurting your own mental health in trying to be so.

Speaking as a wildlife veterinarian, there is absolutely no way that any veterinary school could provide classes that go deep into topics on every taxonomic group (and still manage to cover all the important anatomy/physiology/pharmacology/medicine topics required for medicine in any species) and I’m glad they don’t try. Dog, cat, cow, and horse medicine is the bread and butter of veterinary schools because most people who are there will be primarily working on these species, and those who won’t will base much of the medicine they practice on the concepts learned about these species. I would never be able to work on a tiger if I weren’t comfortable with house cat medicine. The same goes for avian/fish/herps/etc. - most of what we do with these groups is based on what we know about domestic species. There are many schools which do provide excellent training opportunities (didactic courses, rotations, research experience) for those with special interest in wildlife/zoo/zca/aquatics, and even if your school does not provide much of this you still have the opportunity to gain experience while in school through externships and/or summer jobs and attending conventions. This is also a great way to network as training programs and jobs in wildlife/zoo/zca/aquatics/aquaculture are among the most highly competitive and making connections is a good way to break down some of these barriers. The “real” training to prepare you for being comfortable with working on nondomestic species is through internship and residency. And even the 4+ years of specialized post-doc training requires much discipline and drive to study outside of your clinical responsibility (on your days off) in order to be prepared to sit boards to specialize. In short - this lack of experience is on you. Sorry.

Yes, there are many ignorant people who do not see veterinarians as “real doctors”. This should have come as no surprise. There are plenty of jobs where you do not face this sort of speculation regularly, and it’s your choice to let this bother you anyway. If I concerned myself with the opinions of all the ignorant people who speculate about my occupation I would go absolutely mad. The people who matter will see you as a “real doctor”, I promise. 

I work many long days (and nights and weekends). The reality of the schedules worked by many veterinarians also should not have come as a surprise to you. If you are considering working in a field like aquatics or aquaculture, much like in the rest of the zoo/wildlife/exotics world you will absolutely be expected to take some on-call shifts and work weekends throughout your specialty training and career. Depending on your job you may be working with high-profile animals (or those considered food animals) in which case many ailments are considered emergencies, meaning you have some long days ahead of you. However, even in jobs where nights or weekends are worked, a healthy work/life balance is absolutely achievable. It just takes practice and good time management skills. Having to write records at home varies from job to job but I would argue that this is less often the case and largely depends on the individual. I’m actually not allowed to write records at home in my current position. Some of my friends who practice elsewhere write records at home and many do not.

I’m sorry you’ve had such a negative experience in school. Vet school can be challenging in many ways, but it does not have to be like this forever.  Being a veterinarian offers ample opportunity to have a successful career in a variety of fields. I hope you find your happiness.",veterinarian

Turamnab,"Try working as a vet assistant or kennel tech at a clinic or hospital. From there, find out if what you want is to be a veterinarian or a vet tech. Techs, in my experience, work more with patients than clients, whereas the doctors are about 60/40, leaning toward clients.

If you go the tech route you can make an okay living if you know where to look. If you specialize, you won't be wealthy but you can make a little more than the average cost of living in a lot of areas. Doctors make more of course, but they can easily find themselves in a lifetime of debt. The schooling is a pretty massive undertaking as well. Certified techs can be paid off in a couple of years, have school that can be juggled with full time work (especially if you work at a clinic), and in many cases you can ""graduate"" with no debt at all.

Best of luck :)",other

I’m in the process of shadowing on weekends and holidays to try and make up hours, learn as much as I can, and get LORs, so this is more of a “how screwed am I trying to apply this cycle?”|Would you be able to elaborate on how political it is?",other

be quiet, listen and ask a lot of questions- and take notes.

 don't wear perfume and be quiet with cats and dogs . and FFS do not lean down into dogs  faces- just give animals space and don't be all into their faces. I can't tell you how many new people get bit in the face for being idiots. animals are scared at the vet, even if you can't tell and can bit without warning. you won't be able to truly get animal body language for years, so until then just keep your hands to yourself

watch Jackson Galaxy  and Sofia Yin videos on YouTube

muzzle any dog you are not comfortable with no matter what anyone says. I worked for 18 years and was never bit. I would get giant pit bulls we never saw before I muzzled them because  it doesn't hurt their feelings and I felt better ( we saw a lot of pitfalls because we ear crop- not my choice but whatever)

learn Fear Free and Cat Friendly practices- this will take you a year or two but you'll be a better human if you take those to heart.

lastly use food and treats to distract. if your clinic uses them- embrace them, if they don't come back and ask about it

don't expect everyone to welcome you with open arms. its a very stressful job and a new person is time consuming/ and draining to train, even worse when they know nothing. yes they want you there but it could take up to a year to prove that you're trustworthy.

1. We can all learn from each other
2. New grads can be terrible/awkward/wrong in exam rooms
3. Also the support staff details be monitored, these are people you are trusting to do the right thing with the clients

I suggest embrace it.

We have 1 vet ( 8 doctor practice) who was awesome at explaining and had the analogies and I wish the doctors could observe that

thedogviolet,"I feel your pain. Try compression socks and Hokas. Consider making an appointment with a podiatrist or chiropractor to see if you'd benefit from orthotics.|You are having physical symptoms of anxiety and stress. Please go to your doctor and get signed off for stress leave. And GTFO of that toxic mess of a clinic now. Your mental health is too important to try to tough it out.

Not all clinics are pits of despair, but finding a good one is difficult. Take as much time as you need (if you can afford it) and consider your options. When interviewing, be sure to talk to the staff and find out their staff turnover. Do several days of shadowing any potential opportunities and don't sign a 60-day notice period again (and definitely do not sign a non-compete - I don't know where you are in Canada, but some provinces still allow them).  Consider reaching out to local locum vets as they will give you the inside scoop on local practices and whether they'd be a good fit for you or not. If you happen to be in BC, feel free to reach out to me, and I can hopefully get you in touch with people who can help guide you. 

You went to school for so many years and worked so hard getting your DVM- before giving up on the profession, consider time to refresh, renew and gain some perspective. For context, I've practiced for 23 years. I've been an associate, practice owner, worked in specialty and emergency, and now am a locum. I haven't exactly found myself either, but there are a lot of opportunities for different kinds of practice, and many non-clinical opportunities too. 

Good luck!|I have an unpopular opinion as a Canadian vet. Don't take on debt of that magnitude. I have had a couple of very good vet assistants apply to WCVM and be offered non-IPA (non-subsidized) seats for admission, which meant they'd pay about $70,000 a year in tuition (in BC, until recently there were only 20 subsidized IPA seats per year for the entire province). I sat down with them and planned out housing costs, food costs, tuition, etc... during school, and then what loans of that magnitude would mean upon graduation, especially if they wanted to come back to BC (where housing costs are insane) to practice. Both realized that given the average salary for vets here, financially it wasn't worth it. One is now happily in another non-veterinary professional school, and the other went to college for a human health care program that has a similar salary after graduation with far less debt and time in school.  
There are so many of us who are dissatisfied with the profession, and I know a lot of veterinarians who have left or pursued lower-paying, non-clinical roles. But my colleagues who have that huge debt load seem especially worse off, especially concerning their mental health, as they can't afford to explore other options. So my advice would be to make yourself competitive for the in-province option, consider a non-veterinary career, or win the lottery. Good luck to you!|Compression socks and Hokas for the win.",veterinarian

HumorBrilliant3705,"4th year student at another vet school and it’s like that here also. The only department surprisingly that isn’t like this at our school is the emergency/ICU department but probably bc all of the other departments abuse them so badly, they’d never dish that out onto others. Not sure if it’s like this at other schools, but our surgery department is particularly bad. All of the clinicians and residents will outwardly talk about students and/or each other and it’s just so nasty. I can’t wait to graduate and never look back.

If more people like us that actually care about treating people like actual human beings went into specializing, maybe the environment would be different.

After my first self assessment (I did 2 and my 2nd one’s high end was very close to my score), I saw I needed to do better on my feline and equine questions, so I spent 2 weeks studying powerpages and powerlectures and comparing them to my class notes to fill in any gaps for equine and cats. During those 2 weeks, I just did practice questions for all other species. Then I spent 2 more weeks on cats and reviewed dogs at the same time. Then I spent 2 weeks on bovine and reviewed horses at the same time. I mainly focused on the big 4 categories. Then the last 2 weeks I had of studying, I integrated exotics, pigs, poultry, and miscellaneous stuff like how to calculate sensitivity and specificity etc. into my study plan but continued to review the big 4 via questions and powerpages. Now, for these 8 weeks, I was on externships, electives, or off so I had a LOT of time to study (~5-8 hours a day). Another tid bit: my 2nd year I started to have crippling test anxiety where I would just freeze up and forget things, so I’ve been on medication for that ever since.

marwil20,"I'm curious how you've got the numbers for the vet school in the UK? Taking Edinburgh as an example, as that's where I study, tuition for starting next year is 37,500 fixed for the entire 5 years (this varies between schools). 

For living expenses, I would say that I spend less than £10,000 per year, including paying for flights to and from home in the US. That being said, I only go home once per year, round trip flight costing about $800.

Between those two figures the total cost (in GBP) is £237500, which at today's exchange rate is about $299,106.83. Taking into account the comment regarding lost earnings, this would push you even further towards coming to the UK. Obviously, the costs will vary between schools, Edinburgh is (I believe) cheaper for tuition, but a medium-high COL, Glasgow and London being far more expensive.

I know that you wanted to consider the financial aspects of this choice, but I would also urge you to consider the other aspects of the individual institutions you're applying to. The UK vet degree is an undergrad degree - you get to do societies and sports much more than a US vet degree. I might be biased, but I also think that the education process in the UK is much more collaborative between staff and students than in the US. If I want something to change in the programme, I can talk to someone and it more likely than not will happen in some form or another.",other

Questions:
How do you gain veterinary experience with a non-stem major? Where/when can you start?
What do vet schools think about gap years? (I’m planning to take some time off and do/learn about other things I love — farming, backpacking, travel — before vet school.)
What can you do as a vet beyond small animal or equine? Are there positions that allow you to travel and/or help places without many vets, kind of like Doctors Without Borders? 
Is work/life balance pretty impossible? :/

Thank you so so so much! <3",other

hikeswithdogs420,"I've worked for a corporately owned vet and 2 privately owned vet hospitals, the privately owned hospitals were very different than the corporate one. I would be very hesitant to ever take a job at another corporately owned hospital as they seem to mainly just care of money - prices were higher, management was awful, pay was pretty terrible and the employee discount wasnt very great either. One of the private hospitals I worked at payed pretty well but management was terrible. Finding a smaller privately owned hospital was a God send for me, they 100% care more about the patients/clients as well as employees. It can be tough to find a non toxic work environment when your working in vet med but it's worth searching for. I was at my last hospital for 7 years and it had become very toxic, the manager would throw temper tantrums and only cared about money, including when it came down to your own personal pets. I spent about 6 months searching and asking tons of questions to potential new employers and finally found a small, privately owned practice with 100% employee discount... let me tell you, chances are if they're taking good care of their employees they're going to take good care of their patients as well.",veterinarian

Kindly-Metal-6421,"I agree with a lot of things you have mentioned, and most days I am staying unpaid overtime to follow a case, the boss isn’t always there to see,
I was also told to take only vaccine appointments at the beginning and I pushed myself way over my comfort zone and I am taking much more complicated ones. 
I did decline my day off to come in, for the main reason that it was after a full weekend first on call, where I had to come in multiple times and figure out what to do, if I was experienced it wouldnt take as much energy but being entirely new and overthinking everything takes huge energy alone, and that’s why I do need my days off to recover. 
My concern was mainly him overreacting and blaming me for reputation which I never messed with, I found it a bit unreasonable to expect a grad to do invasive surgeries in the first month. 
His job is to teach me and mentor me, he is paying me graduate salary and should expect me to learn and build a foundation with good skills not rushed in and overworked just so I can say I did it in few weeks. 
Otherwise I agree, I do have to put in more work than the others at the start. But I do need more time to recover and reflect. |Hello! I am a vet graduate from an EU university, I had Canadian and American colleagues in the university with me. Make sure you apply for EAEVE accredited schools, it doesn’t matter which tbh, after that if you want to work in the US or Canada, you have to sit the NAVLE, that’s pretty much it. If you want to work in the UK, you only need to apply for equivalence with RCVS, no statutory exam required, I personally did that in less than 1 month. I personally don’t understand why anyone would be willing to have this amount of debt that might go on for years and add to the chances of burn out, there are alternatives. The schools are not free of course, and they are 6 year programs usually (some 5.5years) so if you have an undergraduate you might be able to exempt a few course maybe but you will probably need to start and do full years. Feel free to PM if you have more questions. Take care!|That’s correct, I mentioned that EAEVE accreditation does not qualify you to work as a vet in US or Canada but if the university is listed, you are allowed to do the NAVLE (there are few steps before) and yes they do cost quite a few thousands, but I think it’s reasonable to do that as opposed to stacking up tens of thousands in student loans.

If you asked me in my first 5 years if it was worth it, I would have said absolutely not. Relief work allows you freedom to avoid the many clinics that will work you to death. It pays well, you don’t have to deal with the usual clinic drama, and people are grateful that you are there helping.

Unfortunately, you probably need to do some regular GP for a couple of years before you do relief, to get experience and feel comfortable as a solo practitioner.|Have you considered in-home euthanasia? People who work for Lap of Love always seem very happy and fulfilled. I looked into it once and always have it in the back of my mind to do if I burn out again.|I have heard polarizing opinions.

On one hand, people say they love it. They get paid very well. The fact that clients see everything seems to be a benefit as they can see pets being triaged and better understand why they have to wait.

On the other hand, I’ve heard that the culture is ridiculous and the vet is expected to take every phone call because clients are told they can always reach a doctor. Even if that means taking a phone call to talk about flea control while scrubbed into surgery. 

I’m intrigued by them, but I don’t think I could do my job with clients watching my every move. And I get a lot of cult vibes from them. The people who love it seem so devoted and seem to have nothing bad to say. And the matching t shirts at the conferences.

Naamch3,"Imposter syndrome sure seems to hit a greater # of people in this recent crop of college grads. I wonder why? But for your purposes please don’t let it stop you. Most others in a range of graduating years near you had the Covid impact as well. I have two suggestions. #1 pursue your dream vet job and let nothing stop you…especially yourself. You will grow old regretting it. Knowing you gave up on your dream b/c you lacked confidence will gnaw at you forever and could destroy your mental health over time. Once you get your vet job and are treating patients I doubt the vet practice will allow you to be a sole decision maker on critical cases at first. You and they will want to have an experienced voice in both diagnosis then treatment. Also, be open during your interview. Let them know how much you want the job and ask about mentorship.  Like any medical position a credible veterinary practice will want to assess you before they allow you to fly solo. It might help if you interview at larger practices where they might have more mentoring options. Be upfront about your nervousness. They will appreciate it and tell you that it is normal. If you get an offer from a veterinary practice that doesn’t give you the confidence that there will be mentorship as well as various checks to ensure you cause no outlandish harm then just keep interviewing. Please don’t let that voice in your head cause you to take a desk job and god forbid you take a government job. That sounds like a recipe for a lifetime of regret and pain. I don’t know you but I assume you are better than a government job.

Option #2, if you really are paralyzed by your imposter syndrome then what about interviewing for nurse or technician jobs at vet practices? Or vet / doctor assistant? I apologize for not knowing the right vocabulary for these positions. Sure the pay won’t be what you could make as a veterinary doctor but it provides for a slower start and a longer runway to get your feet under you. As for the economics, assuming the ‘nurse’ job builds you into having the confidence to flip to veterinary doctor then the lifetime earnings will far exceed the giving up option of pursuing that banal government desk job.

Hope this was helpful. A rule of thumb I often use is this, you have only two people in this world to make proud of you. Those two people are your eight year old self and your eighty year old self. Keep them in mind as you choose between pursuing the veterinary career you’ve trained and worked hard for versus the government desk job option.",other

Long_Philosophy_7146,"^ I have 2 snakes and have always dreamed of owning all sorts of unique animals. I see people who don't do research and don't take proper care of exotics. I want to improve education and reduce stigma and get to work with all different kinds of animals. But I also don't want to move super far from home, and I want a job I can survive on.|High school|Thank you! I'm starting to let myself relax and remind myself it's okay to not know exactly what I want to do. I think I'm gonna get a degree in Wildlife and Conservation Biology with a zoological focus. There I'll be able to work with different programs and decide whats next. :)",other
Lopsided-Switch-8404,"My partner is currently an intern at a well known and well regarded small animal rotating internship. I'm in a different profession that is also known for having long hours and a very demanding culture, especially when you first join the profession or work at the ""elite"" level. 

Working long hours because you are in a complex, busy, and demanding profession is fairly understandable to me. What is blowing my mind about the veterinary internship and resident process is the level of abuse interns receive from residents and senior clinicians. Some of the things people say to interns would get people fired immediately in my profession, and my profession is known for having a fairly cutthroat environment. So many senior veterinarians operate with the mentality of ""it was hard for me, and so it should be hard for you."" The point of the internship seems to be suffering and discount labor, not training, patient care, or gaining experience.

This internship has formal rules that are designed to support interns (e.g., an intern can't have more than X number of inpatients at one time; hours limitations related to overnight shifts; etc.) that are openly and flagrantly violated on a daily basis. For example, after working for 15 hours and having well over the maximum number of permitted inpatients my partner asked if someone else could take one of my partner's inpatients. My partner was berated by a resident for being lazy and not caring about their patients. This happened publicly in front of other residents and clinicians and no one said or did anything. This is a common occurrence.

Senior clinicians have said blatantly racist things that the interns are afraid to report due to a culture of retaliation.

There's an in-house social worker who has repeatedly expressed concerns about intern well being and a culture of abuse and exploitation, and those concerns have been brushed off by leadership repeatedly.

There needs to be more oversight of these programs and actual consequences for programs not adhering to their own rules.",other
T_SlaterWitchLocator,"It depends. New client with a complicated situation or a second opinion, I'll chat to them and get a history first, then examine and refine my questions while looking at the animal. Something not so serious, will start exam while chatting. Depends a bit on how full the waiting room is too...

If there's a lot of info I'll start typing notes up in shorthand while talking to the client and then brain-dump everything after I've finished with them. Remembering all the details gets better with practice.

To be honest, a paper sheet sounds tedious as all hell lmao, and you can guarantee it will get wet at some point! Even if it's laminated stuff will rub off.|It depends.

rebelashrunner,"I'm a 27f vet tech and am on the pre-vet track. I have a tattoo on my left wrist, where it is very visible to clients. Hasn't been an issue at all. 

I also have plans for a memorial tattoo set for my heart cat and my two childhood cats (as well as any other pets I've got in the present or future), that will likely end up being a full sleeve over time.

My bosses are part of the older generation of vets (90s grads), and they definitely asked me about my tattoo and its significance in my interview, and occasionally older clients ask about it as well, but overall it's very accepted and comments are usually few and far between, and never negative. Several of my coworkers (closer to my age or younger) have more tattoos than I do, and it has generally never been an issue.

If you're uncomfortable with/concerned about being up front about it in vet school interviews, you can always keep it covered (by a long sleeved blazer or something similar) throughout the interview/touring process. But once you're past the interview stages and in school and in the professional world, it shouldn't be an issue as long as it's not a face tattoo, which is generally still stigmatized more than anywhere else.",other

swin___,"I dont know how easily you could avoid standing during residency, when youre being trained by surgeons that perform while standing and you havr to do things their way. There are also a lot of surgeries for which sitting just wouldn’t be feasible like ortho- I believe most residencies are combined ortho and soft tissue. There are other specialties, like ophtho, that do a lot of surgeries but sit for them. And you could sit for most GP surgeries.",medical doctor
